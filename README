This is a simple plugin I'm doing on request from the server I play on.

There are several complaints about language on this server, so this plugin
aims to help combat this issue by censoring and fining players based on their chat.

I hope to support censoring players, levying fines against them thru the iConomy 
plugin, and maybe even implementing temporary bans after continual usage.

Possible future support for:
 - other economy plugins.
 - player damage or inventory based fines?
 - Ummm, I dunno. I'm open to suggestions...
